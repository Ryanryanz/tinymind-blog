● Thinking Out Loud: How to Use Your Voice in Knowledge Work 
https://nesslabs.com/thinking-out-loud  
1. Why：    
　　1.1 Speaking engages unique mental pathways. Vocalizing thoughts activates the phonological loop in working memory, lightens cognitive load, and taps into emotion‑ and empathy‑related brain regions. nesslabs.com    
　　1.2. Improves clarity & memory. Explaining ideas aloud enhances understanding (self‑explanation effect) and boosts retention due to the production effect.  

2. Five practical voice‑driven techniques  
　　2.1. Walk through complex problems aloud — explaining ideas as if teaching clarifies logic and unlocks hidden insights. nesslabs.com  
　　2.2. Record brainstorming sessions — voice memos capture spontaneous, creative thoughts that can be lost in slow typing. nesslabs.com  
　　2.3. Vocalize writing drafts — reading your drafts out loud helps spot awkward phrasing, tone issues, and logic gaps.nesslabs.com  
　　2.4. Dictate during walks — combining movement and speech fuels mental momentum and clarity. nesslabs.com  
　　2.5. Rehearse key points aloud — prepare for meetings or presentations by practicing your main talking points.  

● 真正的休息

1. Three-step formula for truly restorative breaks  
　　1.1. Fully switch off
Avoid cognitively demanding activities (e.g. browsing news, shopping, checking email) even during breaks—such tasks tap the same mental resources as work and don’t offer real rest.Instead, opt for relaxation (e.g. daydreaming, stretching) or socializing—these have been shown to buffer stress and reduce end-of-day fatigue.  
　　1.2. Take short breaks, early and often
Morning mini-breaks are more rejuvenating—your mental “tank” needs some fuel to refill effectively.Frequent short pauses (even a few minutes) are more effective—and less disruptive—than infrequent longer breaks.  
　　1.3. Get out of the office
A brief outdoor excursion, even just a five-minute walk, away from work visuals and mindset can significantly restore mental energy.Indoor social breaks, especially if pressured or work-related, can leave you just as—or even more exhausted.  

2. Key takeaways  
　　2.1. Truly nourishing breaks require switching off from work-like thinking and environments.  
　　2.2. Schedule consistent, brief rest periods throughout the morning and day.  
　　2.3. Stepping outside adds a powerful rejuvenating effect.  
　　2.4. Doing so not only boosts immediate productivity and creativity—but also improves recovery after work and long-term wellbeing.

● 中国仿制药：中国目前面临的挑战，不是“要不要仿制药”，而是“如何让仿制药成为患者值得信赖的选择”。我们呼吁：优化集采政策，打破唯价格论，引入多元评价维度，为企业提供合理利润空间，确保企业有能力持续投入上市后质量控制；药品监管机构应加强仿制药上市后监督，定期抽查仿制药质量，严肃处理、打击违规企业。

● kk：始终要求一个截止日期。截止日期能剔除多余和普通的内容，它能防止你试图让作品变得“完美”，所以你只能让它变得“与众不同”。与众不同比完美更重要。
带着借口的道歉，不是真正的道歉。带着请求的赞美，不是真正的赞美。
成功秘诀：少承诺，多兑现。
